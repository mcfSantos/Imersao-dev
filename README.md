<h1> Hey Guy! </h1> 
<h2> I'm Santos! </h2> 
This is my first immersion oriented by Alura School! <br> 
I'm tI trying to improve my english too, so its i write my codes in english, sometimes it's a problem, because i can make a mistake in code and in English,<br>
but, I belive I will improve my code and my english in the same time if I persist every day. <br>
I started with few notions in programming logic for my first steps in JavaScript! <br>
At the moment, from that experience, maybe i don't like frontend, I was more comfortable and I feel more useful in the backend <br>   
Do you want to know my first projects?? click on! <br>
I know it's just my first step in my careear transitions!
